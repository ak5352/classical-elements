# Classical Elements

### I used Professor Clayton's Icon System

His original icon system used:

* Earth
* Wind
* Fire
* Water
* Æther


I added:

* Density

The reason I chose to do an icon for this particular project is that the subject of
classical elments fascinates me. I wanted to do something to represent the opposite 
of Æther, which represents the void. Therefore, I chose to create an element that
represents the densest form.
